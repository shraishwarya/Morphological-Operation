# Morphological Operations using Deep Learning

Morphological operations are fundamental image processing techniques used to extract meaningful structures, remove noise, and enhance object features in binary and grayscale images. Traditionally, they are performed using simple kernel-based methods such as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing.

This project explores **Deep Learning approaches** for learning morphological operations, comparing them against traditional methods and evaluating their performance on different datasets.
